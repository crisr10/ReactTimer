# React Timer
Timer and Countdown application made in React js. In the nav bar there are routes to both the timer page and the countdown page. Timer gets started with the Start button. You can then pause the timer or clear it to start again. Add seconds to the countdown form to start it. You can pause it and clear the timer to start a new countdown.

Clone the repo to your local machine. Then on the terminal run the commannd `npm install` to install all the dependencies already saved in package JSON. Once the installation is complete, run `webpack` to save the node_modules in the bundle file, and then run `npm start` to start the server localhost:3000.

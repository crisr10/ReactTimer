# React Timer
Timer and Countdown application made in React.js.

* [Live Demo](http://reacttimerapp-cris.herokuapp.com)

## Usage
In the nav bar there are routes to both the timer page and the countdown page. 
Timer gets started with the Start button. You can then pause the timer or clear it to start again. Add seconds to the countdown form to start it. You can pause it and clear the timer to start a new countdown. 

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo to your local machine. 
2. Inside the terminal run the commannd `npm install` to install all the dependencies already saved in package JSON. 
3. Run `webpack` to save the node_modules in the bundle file
4. Run `npm start` to start the server localhost:3000. 
5. Go on your browser and type localhost:3000 in the adress field. The app should be running there now.

## Testing 
I wrote a couple of tests for the components. You can run these in the terminal using `npm test`.
If you want to take a look at each one of the tests, they're located inside of ./app/tests/components
